#Personal Event Summary
The goal of this system is to create a personalized "Wrapped Page" that is created for attendees of an event as post event step.  This page would showcase the value created for an attendee. Event organizers would be delighted with our ability to create a personalized page for every single person at the show.   

Example: https://meet-you-in-bcn.vitafoods.eu.com/1234 here's an example website from one of our competitors that is personalized for Lauren, and included in their post event engagement marketing.
